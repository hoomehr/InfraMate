*Note: The automatic AI analysis could not be generated. Here are some general security recommendations:*

## General Security Best Practices

1. **Use IAM roles with least privilege access**
   - Restrict permissions to only what is necessary
   - Regularly review and audit permissions

2. **Encrypt sensitive data**
   - Use AWS KMS for managing encryption keys
   - Enable encryption at rest for all data stores
   - Enable encryption in transit

3. **Network Security**
   - Use security groups with restrictive inbound/outbound rules
   - Implement network ACLs for additional security
   - Use private subnets for sensitive resources

4. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Enable CloudTrail for API logging
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activities
   - Implement centralized logging

5. **Resource Configuration**
   - Disable public access where not needed
   - Use secure TLS versions
   - Keep software and dependencies updated
